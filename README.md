# cumm
CUda Matrix Multiply library.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

```cumm``` is developed during learning of [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass), which use too much c++ template and make code unmaintainable. So I develop [pccm](https://github.com/FindDefinition/PCCM), use python as meta programming language, to replace c++ template meta programming. 
Now ```pccm``` become a foundational framework of ```cumm``` and my other c++ project such as [spconv](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv). 
```cumm``` also contains a python asyncio-based gemm simulator that **share same meta program** with CUDA code, enable gemm visualization and easy debug experience.

## BREAKING CHANGES

* 0.3.1: tv::DType enum value changed, this will affect all binary code of tv::Tensor user. you must recompile all code if upgrade to cumm >= 0.3.1.

## News

* Ampere feature support (by [EvernightAurora](https://github.com/EvernightAurora))

## Install

### Prebuilt

We offer python 3.9-3.13 and cuda 11.4/11.8/12.1/12.4/12.6 prebuilt binaries for linux (`manylinux_2_28`).

We offer python 3.9-3.13 and cuda 11.4/11.8/12.1/12.4/12.6 prebuilt binaries for windows 10/11.

We offer python 3.9-3.13 prebuilt binaries for Mac OS X >= 14.0 (Apple Silicon Only).

```pip install cumm``` for CPU-only

```pip install cumm-cu114``` for CUDA 11.4

```pip install cumm-cu126``` for CUDA 12.6

### Build from source for development (JIT, recommend for develop)

**WARNING** Use code in [tags](https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm/releases)!!! code in main branch may contain bugs.

The c++ code will be built automatically when you change c++ code in project.

#### Linux

0. uninstall cumm installed by pip. you must ensure no "cumm" exists in ```pip list | grep cumm```
1. install build-essential, install CUDA
2. ```git clone https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm```, ```cd ./cumm```, ```git checkout tags/<tag_name>```, ```pip install -e .```
3. in python, ```import cumm``` and wait for build finish.

#### Windows
0. uninstall spconv and cumm installed by pip. you must ensure no "cumm" exists in ```pip list | grep cumm```
1. install visual studio 2019 or newer. make sure C++ development component is installed. install CUDA
2. set [powershell script execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.1)
3. start a new powershell, run ```tools/msvc_setup.ps1```
4. ```git clone https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm```, ```cd ./cumm```, ```git checkout tags/<tag_name>```, ```pip install -e .```
5. in python, ```import cumm``` and wait for build finish.

### Build wheel from source 

**WARNING** Use code in [tags](https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm/releases)!!! code in main branch may contain bugs.

**WARNING**: If ```CUMM_CUDA_VERSION``` is set with a CUDA version, following steps will create a wheel named "cumm-cuxxx", not "cumm", this means you must use ```cumm-cuxxx``` in dependency of your project which depend on cumm, not ```cumm```. If ```CUMM_CUDA_VERSION``` isn't set, ```cumm``` will always built with CUDA, so the CUDA must exists in your system. The wheel name will be ```cumm``` even if it is built with cuda.

#### Linux

It's recommend to build Linux packages in [official build docker](https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml). Build with CUDA support don't need a real GPU.

##### Build in Official Docker

1. select a cuda version. available: CUDA 11.1, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 12.0
2. (Example for CUDA 11.4) ```git clone https://github.com/FindDefinition/cumm```, ```cd ./cumm```, ```docker run --rm -e PLAT=manylinux2014_x86_64 -e CUMM_CUDA_VERSION=114 -v `pwd`:/io scrin/manylinux2014-cuda:cu114-devel-1.0.0 bash -c "source /etc/bashrc && /io/tools/build-wheels.sh"```

##### Build in your environment

1. install build-essential, install CUDA
2. set env for installed cuda version. for example, ```export CUMM_CUDA_VERSION="11.4"```. If you want to build CPU-only, run ```export CUMM_CUDA_VERSION=""```. If ```CUMM_CUDA_VERSION``` isn't set, you need to ensure cuda libraries are inside OS search path, and the built wheel name will be ```cumm```, otherwise ```cumm-cuxxx```
3. run ```export CUMM_DISABLE_JIT="1"```
4. run ```python setup.py bdist_wheel```+```pip install dists/xxx.whl```

#### Windows 10/11

1. install visual studio 2019 or newer. make sure C++ development package is installed. install CUDA
2. set [powershell script execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.1)
3. start a new powershell, run ```tools/msvc_setup.ps1```
4. set env for installed cuda version. for example, ```$Env:CUMM_CUDA_VERSION = "11.4"```. If you want to build CPU-only, run ```$Env:CUMM_CUDA_VERSION = ""```. . If ```CUMM_CUDA_VERSION``` isn't set, you need to ensure cuda libraries are inside OS search path, and the built wheel name will be ```cumm```, otherwise ```cumm-cuxxx```
4. run ```$Env:CUMM_DISABLE_JIT = "1"```
5. run ```python setup.py bdist_wheel```+```pip install dists/xxx.whl```
